That's great\! You've made some smart improvements to your `src/agent.py`, particularly by explicitly handling the API key and setting a specific Groq model.

Based on the model name you used (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`), I need to provide a **small correction for the model ID** as the Groq API typically uses simpler IDs. However, since the documentation shows `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` as an accepted ID, I will update the `README.md` to reflect the specific, powerful model you are using and ensure the setup instructions are precise for your code structure.

Here is the complete `README.md` file, ready to be pasted into the GitHub edit section:

# 💪 GroqFit AI Coach: Ultra-Fast Fitness Chatbot

## 🚀 Project Overview

**GroqFit AI Coach** is a high-performance, personalized fitness and nutrition chatbot built for speed. It leverages the orchestration capabilities of **LangChain** and the cutting-edge, low-latency inference of the **Groq API** to provide near-instantaneous, motivating fitness advice. The chatbot is deployed using **Streamlit** for a seamless web experience.

### ✨ Key Features

  * **⚡ Groq Speed:** Uses the powerful **`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`** model on Groq's LPU architecture for lightning-fast responses.
  * **🧠 Contextual Memory:** Remembers your goals and previous questions using LangChain's conversational memory.
  * **🧑‍⚕️ Safety-First Persona:** Acts as a motivating coach, always including a crucial **medical disclaimer**.
  * **💻 Streamlit UI:** Features a simple, interactive chat interface.

## 💻 Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** and **Git** installed.

### 2\. Clone the Repository and Navigate

```bash
git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
cd fitness-ai-coach
```

### 3\. Set up the Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment (choose one)
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries (LangChain, Groq, Streamlit, etc.) from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Configure Groq API Key

1.  Get your **Groq API Key** from the Groq console.

2.  Open the **`.env`** file in your project root.

3.  Add your key exactly as follows:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_actual_groq_api_key_here"
    ```

    *(The `src/agent.py` script uses `python-dotenv` to load this key.)*

### 6\. Run the Chatbot

With your virtual environment active, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ☁️ Deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud

Deployment is straightforward, but requires securely setting your API key.

1.  **Commit and Push Code:** Ensure your `app.py`, `src/agent.py`, and `requirements.txt` are all updated and pushed to your **GitHub repository**.

2.  **Go to Streamlit Cloud:** Log in and start the deployment process by linking your repository.

3.  **Set Secrets (Crucial Step):** Streamlit Cloud requires you to set secrets through its dashboard, not a committed file.

      * In the deployment's **Advanced Settings**, find the **Secrets** section.
      * Paste your key in the correct TOML format:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="<Your-Groq-API-Key>"
    ```

    *(The variable name must exactly match `GROQ_API_KEY` to be picked up by the `os.getenv` call in your agent code.)*

4.  **Deploy:** Click **"Deploy\!"** Your ultra-fast AI Coach will now be live on the web\!

## 🧠 Core Logic Snapshot (`src/agent.py`)

The core logic is modularized in `src/agent.py`.

  * **LLM Model:** `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` is explicitly used for high-quality, fast generation.
  * **API Key Handling:** The key is securely loaded via `load_dotenv()` and passed directly to the `ChatGroq` constructor.
  * **Memory:** `ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5)` ensures the agent maintains context across the last five turns.

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Snippet from src/agent.py
# ...
MODEL_NAME = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" 

llm = ChatGroq(
    api_key=GROQ_API_KEY,
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    temperature=0
)
# ...
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5, memory_key="history", return_messages=True)
# ...
```
